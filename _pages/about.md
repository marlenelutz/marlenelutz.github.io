I am a third-year PhD Student at [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/) supervised by [Professor Markus Strohmaier](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/information-systems/chairs/prof-dr-strohmaier/team/prof-dr-markus-strohmaier/). I am interested in computational social science and responsible NLP research, with a focus on advancing  fairness and interpretability in language technologies. Currently, I'm working on measuring and improving demographic representativeness in language models.

Previously, I obtained my M.Sc. (with distinction) in Computer Science at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), where I also worked as a research assistant.
